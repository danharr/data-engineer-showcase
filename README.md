### how managers signed the current squad
This example uses
- Python
- pyspark
- Pandas, Beautiful Soup
- Docker
- node.js
- dbt (data build tool)
- Snowflake
- Tableau Public
- AWS (Lambda, ECR, S3)

and takes unstructured data from various sites to then create a football based question about how a team's squad has been created over the years.

Below is the summary of how I use various AWS services to fetch, clean and transform data
