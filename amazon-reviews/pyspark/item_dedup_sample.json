Oddly enough, there is such a book, apparently edited by Mr. Hyun and illustrated by Mr. Park.Well, as it turns out, &quot;Reader Turntable SE-14&quot; is not a book. It is, well, a reader turntable: a black rectangular piece of 1/2&quot; particleboard, about 13x16 inches, mounted on a bearing so it can rotate easily. It's a lot like a &quot;Lazy Susan&quot;.It's useful for reading rooms, libraries, etc. Place it on table, put a dictionary or other big heavy reference book on it, and now folks sitting on either side of the table can share the reference, simply turning it towards them when they need to look something up.Construction is sturdy.

The elastic has very nice give and the layers of tulle are very nicely proportioned and soft. After throwing it in the wash, the edges can curl a little with minimal fray--maybe I could have put it on a gentler cycle, but it looks pretty much lithe same. I really like the way the elastic is sewn in. The satin edge is part of the tulle fabric, not sewn on, and the elastic is enclosed between the layers of the satin edge, making it seem pretty secure.

They were however, crushed. While I still love Giada's cooking, this set is just a way for Food Network to make money. They really cheated with these DVD's. All they have are the video from the show, no text recipes, no link to the on line shows and no computer support. They play in Windows media player but the set does not contain the recipes. You can get more by taping the shows and then going to the web to download recipes. Another disappointment is the so so transfer quality to DVD. Perhaps I've been spoiled by HD and Tivo but the older shows I've recorded have had better playback quality than the episodes on the DVD's. It is in the old 480p but the quality of the transfer to DVD is dark and about the same quality as your average old VHS tape, not DVD quality. I get the impression Food Network got cheap and subbed out the DVD transfer to the lowest bidder (China?) and it shows.I could watch Giada read the dictionary and her cooking is really first rate. But, that's all you get is watching Giada. Thank god she is easy to understand and her recipes are easy to follow. But to get consistent results on some of the dishes, you should search the web and find the hard copies.  While Giada herself is great, this set is a waste of money. You're better off recording the shows and going to the web to get the recipes you want or, better yet, just stick with her cookbooks which are all first rate and worlds above this cheap presentation.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Don't waste your money", "unixReviewTime": 1216252800, "reviewTime": "07 17, 2008"}

Being a control freak, I struggled to understand even the delicate changes occurring in my son.  I spent hours, days, months researching addiction, recovery and relapse, hoping to find the magic cure.  And then I was handed, \"Why Don't They Just Quit\", the award winning self-help book written by Joe and Judy Herzanek.Joe writes a powerful and honest account of his own struggle with addiction and subsequent successful recovery, thirty years strong.  He provides valuable and often misunderstood insights from the addict's point of view, offering amazingly simple reasons for why the addict does not quit.\"Consequences became a reason for using, not a deterrent\" Joe explains as he explores reasons addicts just don't quit.  Drugs dull the senses, numb the pain and fade the situations, allowing the addict an escape from their problems. \"People use drugs to increase pleasure and decrease pain,\" writes  Joe.\"Families and friends always try to help the addict see the problem. It doesn't happen over night. They do not see the problem as it unfolds; this person typically is in denial. They will typically put this off rather than confront.\" Joe HerzanekDespite mounting pressures, whether financial, social, legal or emotional, the addict cannot see the problem for what it has become; rather the mounting pressures become the reason to continue using, in order to NOT deal with them. It seems so obvious when Joe describes the stress and the inability to deal with it that creates the vicious cycle I helplessly watched my son spiral through.Joe recounts personal failures and near tragic family circumstances as a result of addictions, but also provides a road map of sorts to navigate through the cause and progression of addiction, the treatment options as well as common sense answers to not so simple questions.In \"Why Don't They Just Quit\" Joe aptly dispels the myth of hitting rock bottom:\"This whole idea of \"hitting bottom\" is out of date. Some people with wait years-even decades- for their friends to reach thus mythical point in their alcohol and drug use. But why wait for them to \"hit bottom\"? Why not help them by raising their bottom? There are ways to encourage someone to reach their bottom much earlier. In doing so. We can avoid a lot of unnecessary pain and heartache- and maybe even save their life. For some people, hitting bottom will be six feet underground\". Joe HerzanekAs I struggled to `tough love' it with my son, I never thought of it as raising his bottom. I only looked at as a way to preserve my sanity, and then only after I attempted to help my son, which really meant enabling the behavior to continue.\"So does everyone have to hit rock bottom? I would say no. Tough love can prevent a substance abuser from prolonging their usage. There are loving ways to refuse to rescue someone that in the long run will help them to choose recovery.\"Loving means doing the right thing to help.\" Joe HerzanekJoe leaves no stone unturned when it comes to addiction and its far-reaching consequences. Addiction affects the entire family, from spouses, to parents, to siblings.Full of useful quotes and quips from both famous and not so famous, as well as personal adages from his family and friends, Joe Herzanek takes a very messy, complex and taboo subject, and twists it into a story of hope, courage and healing \"Quitting is a moment in time. It is not recovery\" Joe warns the reader.  He provides treatment options and despite being a chaplain, he tempers his own faith with the 12-step `higher power\".\"The last thing I want to do in this section is to get too preachy. Spiritual growth is very personal. What I am saying is that spirituality is a big part of recovery and is too important to ignore.\" Joe HerzanekI highly recommend this read to any person living with or loving an addict. A toolbox of helpful insights, answers to seemingly impossible questions, and road map through the struggles of addiction; this book is the ultimate idiots guide to addiction, recovery and relapse, and a must to all struggling in this realm.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Why Don't THEY Just Quit?", "unixReviewTime": 1322956800, "reviewTime": "12 4, 2011"}

When one family member falls ill from the disease of addiction, everything is seen through a shattered mirror from everyone.

His advice put us on the path to really help our son.  Dealing with and recognizing the fact that one has this disease is a slow, and evolving process that calls for intense work, introspection, commitment, and more.  It also requires that a family make a paradigm shift away from accusations to the addict and past unworkable behaviors, toward taking baby steps to forgiveness, a return to love, health and focus on one day at a time.  We found it to be an invaluable reference, and have gone back to visit it many times.  Keeping an open mind is vital to dealing with addiction.

To show this to a population of substance abusers would put them to sleep. The kind of addiction films that stimulate my clients are the ones that explain how they got addicted, why they are addicted, and what can be done about it from a psychological, biological, and physiology perspective. Psychological, biological, and physiological films make them feel as if they are a person first with some issues, instead of making them feel they are labeled as a problem with the identity of an alcoholic or addict (a person second) in which this DVD takes that position. Good addiction films today move fast, scene to scene, with music in background and people talking scene to scene with speed.

Limited pipeline capacity forces moving the product on barges and trains, adding up to $17/barrel.

It is said that Kahlil spent more than 20 years writing The Prophet and held onto the manuscript for 4 years before finally releasing it for publication. Kahlil referred to The Prophet as the \"strange little book\" or \"the little black book\" in reference to its cover. The working title of this strange little book was \"The Counsels\" - the final version consisting of 26 `verses'.In The Prophet the philosophy of East and West meet in a union unparalleled in the literature of the early 20th century. Kahlil acknowledged that he was inspired by a multitude of writers and that is evident throughout The Prophet. Most notably the visions of William Blake, who Kahlil referred to as \"the poet-prophet par-excellence\" (incidentally one of Kahlil's mentors the sculptor Rodin called Kahlil the 20th century Blake), The Prophet was also heavily influenced by the Bible, Buddhism, Hinduism, the English Romantics, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ameen Rihani, and Christian and Sufi mysticism.When The Prophet was first published the early 20th century critic Claude Bragdon wrote of its, \"extraordinary dramatic power, deep erudition, lightning-like intuition, lyrical lift and metrical mastery with which the message is presented, and the beauty, beauty, beauty, which permeates the entire pattern.\" Wow that's a powerful critique...and let's listen to his close friend and one of his biographers Mary Haskell who wrote to Kahlil after she received a copy of The Prophet:\"Beloved Kahlil, The Prophet came today, and it did more than realize my hopes. For it seemed in its compacted form to open yet further new doors of desire and imagination in me, and to create about itself the universe in nimbus......This book will be held as one of the treasures of English literature. And in our darkness we will open it to find ourselves again and the heaven and earth within ourselves. Generations will not exhaust it, but instead, generation after generation will find in the book what they would fain be - and it will be better loved as men grow riper and riper.

It is small and sits easily in one hand. The pages are made from a rich-feeling, textured paper that feels nice to the fingertips. And the text is printed in spacious and easy to read letters. Throughout the book are scattered drawings that Kahlil Gibran made. I like them. I feel they add to the experience of reading this book, although I can't quite put my finger on the reason.While spiritual, it does not, as far as I could tell, convey any beliefs specific to any religion or even assume a readily recognizable god. Gibran says, \"... the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks, than to the least of all the blades of grass.\" (pp 27-28)  The notion of god that emerges from these pages is of a pervasive connectedness or oneness with nature and the universe.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Delightful to read and hold", "unixReviewTime": 1261612800, "reviewTime": "12 24, 2009"}

At the time, I found it beautiful, but I couldn't understand it. That is because I hadn't experienced life.Selections from this book were read at my wedding. The sections on love speak of what it is truly about. Most of us never have an inkling of what true love is since we are caught up in a world of attachment to illusions and delusions. This book will help you to break through them.This is a classic that will stand the mark of time such as the Bible has done. Kahlil Gibran is an old soul who speaks in a language that can be embraced by people of any faith.The book is filled with metaphors and parables.

When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.\"  G. K. Gibran, The ProphetThe Prophet:Gibran's best-known work, The Prophet, is a collection of poetic essays, which became more popular with the rise of American New Age movement during the 1960s. Since its first publication in 1923, The Prophet has never been out of print. It was translated into more than twenty languages, and became one of the twentieth century best selling books, in the United States. The Prophet evoked the journey of the Promeathian exile, he called Al Mustafa (the Chosen One, one of Islam's prophet favorite adjectives). Gibran added to the work, a separate work he had attached to the story of Al Mustafa. Gibran has later linked the roots of his poetic collection to a work he wrote as a teenager in Arabic.Quote from The Prophet, Self-knowledge:*Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart's knowledge.You would know in words that you have always known in thought.You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.*And it is well that you should.The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea; and the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.For self is a sea boundless and measureless.G. Khalil Gibran, 1883-1931:I encountered Gibran as a young kid, even before appreciating Arabic poetry. I was then amazed by the beauty of his art and the romance of his expression, in 'The Prophet.' I read him, later in Arabic, before I realized how the Lebanese emigrant poet has touched the Western hearts. Gibran's collection of early stories, parables and poetic prose, were written in Arabic before his works were translated into English, earning him the nickname 'the Shelly of the Orient.' Many Arabic speaking intelligentsia, including my dad thought he has qualified, before Naguib Mahfouz was elected, to have been the first Nobel Laureate Arabic writer !Classic Book Reviews:\"It is Gibran's gift to us, as well, for Gibran's prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world's great religions. --his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description \"divinely inspired.\"  Brian Bruya\"His power came from some great reservoir of spiritual life else it could not have been so universal and so potent, but the majesty and beauty of the language with which he clothed it were all his own.\"  Claude BragdonPROPHET: LIFE AND TIMES OF KAHLIL GIBRAN", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Gibran's Prophet-worthy Poetic Wisdom", "unixReviewTime": 1259452800, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2009"}

At its simplest, it is a discourse on the human condition: love, work, joy and sorrow, crime and punishment, reason and passion, Gibran runs the gamut of emotion and being, laying bare the paradox of who we are as human beings.  While the tone is somewhat mystical (which I didn't really care for), the sheer poetic beauty of his writing moved me.For example, in the chapter \"Love\", Gibran writes, \"... When love beckons to you, follow him, / Though his ways are hard and steep, / And when his wings enfold you yield to him, / Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. / And when he speaks to you believe in him, / ... For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.  Even as he is for you growth so is he for your pruning. ...\"  The contrast, vivid metaphor and beautiful images were stunning and left me with much to think and reflect on about my own life, and the choices I've made.  It would be going too far to say that, as a result of reading \"The Prophet\" I've had an epiphany or (to take it to a ridiculous conclusion) some sort of a conversion.  Rather it has caused me to consider on a philosophical level what it is to be human means to me, and how I have demonstrated my \"human-ness\" in my life.Part poetry, part philosophy, it is simultaneously thought-provoking and emotional.  Undeniably readers will have a visceral reaction (although, apparently given the reviews of some, not all reactions are positive.)

Before he goes, many people have just one question to ask him.  In a very few words, he tells them his accumulated wisdom primarily in a nondenominational way.  The only exceptions come in the references to rebirth.  The essence of each brief lesson is that we have to step outside of our own perspective to see things in the way that God does and wants us to.Let me give you an example.  When someone transgresses either man's laws or God's laws, we tend to condemn the person harshly and focus on punishment.  This is like treating the person as though they have fallen below some level of what it is still to be human.  Yet no one does anything worse than what some person has done wrong before and will do wrong again.Surely, our reaction should still focus, like a Mother's, on the fundamental humanness of the person and our desire to have the person be a contributing, loving, and helpful part of our community.Another way to think about the lessons of The Prophet is to notice that nature loves a balance.  If we interfere with nature, nature overreacts in some new way that counters our interference.  This happens when we put too much phosphate into lakes.  Algae blooms expand exponentially to eat the phosphate.  These lessons help us to see the balance that is missing in our initial reaction.A good parallel can be found in the study of the brain.  Our initial reactions when frightened or threatened are focused in the oldest parts of the brain.  This part of the brain triggers strong chemicals to be released that engage us in &quot;fight or flight&quot; reactions that can save our lives in the near-term.  In the &quot;civilized&quot; world, we often have these reactions just to stress.  Gibran is helping us move to our highest level of consciousness by choosing our reactions, and selecting reactions that integrate all parts of our brains plus our near- and long-term best interests as individuals and as a community.Many Eastern religions encourage one to become free of the conscious mind, and that sense of objectivity is captured nicely here.  I have a feeling much like when meditating while I read The Prophet, because of its calming influence on my overreactive senses.I also think of this perspective like being on the Moon and observing the circumstances on Earth through a telescope.  With such extreme distance should come detachment from the ego, to permit good thinking.But none of these perspectives are directly suggested or alluded to.  The moral lessons are simply there, with the briefest possible examples to make them clear.  As such, they are masterpieces of good thinking, moral ethics, and fine communication.The answers are so brief and so profound that you will want to discuss them.  I suggest you select another member of your family, or a group of people from your house of worship.  The lessons are best explored by discussing tangible situations that you face every day.  Certainly, it is desirable and appropriate to consider the direct teachings of your religious heritage and beliefs in this connection.Whenever you feel overwhelmed, turn to the page in The Prophet that addresses your issue.  Like taking a warm bath, you will be soothed by the love for humanity in the answers Gibran provides.Before you speak, ask yourself who is about to speak for you and what do they want.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Transcend Human Subjectivity to Find Godlike Objectivity", "unixReviewTime": 980380800, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2001"}

I had been trying unsuccessfully for weeks to send out an SOS to a life-long friend whose comforting presence I really needed, even if just by phone.  Long, sun-lit walks through my beautiful neighborhood lined with 100+ year old oaks, magnolias, elms, and maple trees, did not make me feel any better.  At home, the news is only reporting the political and ecomonic turmoil going on world-wide, or the Oscars; the latter which I could care less about.  It was a very sad and loney moment.Back in Miami I would naturally hit the beach, or watch the ocean from my balcony and forget the world.  So, in desperation, I jumped in my vehicle, hit the book store, and called on the wisdom of Mr. Gibran.  I sipped a glass of red, kicked back on my couch, and slowly read aloud each blessed passage on all the areas of life and the challenges they can present.  I don't know why, but this book always makes me cry at the beginning and smile at the end.  In little over an hour I'd read slowly through each page, and felt 100% better.On physical inspection, this would be the student slackers paradise book report choice.

The words are brief and powerful, comforting and idiot-proof.  Perfect healing food for the love-starved yet attention-deficit crazy world we now live in.  I was first given this book by a friend, as a departing gift for a 7,000 land/sea voyage, back in 1983.I hope to be there for my friend should he ever need me.

Yet, this book had been a bestseller LONG before the 1960s. Originally published in 1923, it almost instantly became a hit and even did well through the Great Depression. Today, Gibran's claim to fame is being the third best-selling poet of our time, behind Shakespeare and Lao Tzu... and pretty much entirely based on sales of this book. When his publisher, Alfred Knopf was asked who the audience for the book was, he flippantly dismissed the question. \"It Must be a cult,\" he retorted.Yet there is no such cult. What's incredible is that there's absolutely no marketing hype behind the success of this book. Gibran himself is long gone. There is no political, religious, or commercial enterprise attached to his name bent on winning souls and/or profits. The Gibran estate has merely been licensing copies year after year in response to the demand - a demand fueled pretty much entirely by word-of-mouth and chance discovery. The fact is, the twenty-six poems in this book have a surprising and suprassing relevance, insight and compassion. Broken down into several topics (\"On Love\", \"On Work\", \"On Joy and Sorrow\", etc.) the book itself recounts the sermons of a fictional poet leaving behind the gift of knowledge before he leaves his homeland.I first found Gibran through a setting of his poem \"On Children\" by local Washington, D.C. singers Sweet Honey in the Rock on their album, \"Breaths.\"\"Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.\"At the time I was about to leave for college and eighteen years of living under my parent's roof had made me restless for autonomy. That poem eloquently expressed everything I was yearning to say to them in my hours of frustration and adolescent angst. It later proved to be a reference to turn to in times where I needed confidence to live an independent and fulfilling life, while still maintaining respect and compassion towards the parents who had raised me.I am not exaggerating when I say that the poems in this book have kept me grounded and sane throughout some of the most troubling times in my life. Our modern lives are ever hectic, stressful and busy - wrought with drama, frustration, depression, etc. The knowledge in these poems brings me back to a \"middle ground\" - there is a sage wisdom and clarity in the poems that has often been helpful for me in \"unwinding\" and coming back to earth. They bring me back to a place of clarity from whcih I can see my life from a wider perspective.Though Gibran himself was a Christian and despite the title and conceit of the book, this is not really a religious book. The insight in this book would be applicable to your life even if you are an atheist. What's more, the poetry is mostly imagistic. Do not expect the academic poetics of Gibran's contemporaries Eliot or Pound or even Frost. They are written with the aim of being accessible and immediate to the reader and rely mostly on clear metaphors and vivid imagery.Copies of \"The Prophet\" are not hard to come by. Perhaps check out the book's table of contexts either using Amazon's \"Search Inside\" feature or in your local bookstore and see if it addresses a problem or issue you are dealing with. That's a good a place as any to start with.

It works as prose poetry, in fact some of the best in English.  That is probably because Gibran somewhat mimics the poetry of the King James Version.  Some phrases and turns and images are brilliant.That said, what is the point of this book?  There are some nice things.  \"Is not religion all deeds and all reflections....  Who can separate his faith from his actions....  Who can spread his hours before him, saying, 'This is for God and this is for myself; This for my soul, and this other for my body?'\"Good point.  There are several such nuggets.  But, you can tell why the hippie-set loved this book: it is spirituality devoid of religion.  Namely, this book can make you feel all \"cosmic\" without all that pesky Christian morality.  That bit quoted above, it is followed by: \"He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.\"Ah.  See what morals get you.  On crime and punishment, we get this \"It Takes a Village\" gem: \"And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.\"  See, crime is not the fault of the criminal, it is the fault of society.  \"The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked... Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured.\"  See, if you self-righteous rich folk didn't oppress the meek poor folk, they wouldn't have to commit crime.I wonder how the injured rape victim victimized her guilty rapist.Generally, the twin credos of \"The Prophet\" are (1) any path to God is the right path, and (2) if it feels good do it.(1)  Thus, the pluralistic relativism of lines like:\"Say not, 'I have found the truth,' but rather, 'I have found a truth.'  Say not, 'I have found the path of the soul.' Say rather, 'I have met the soul walking upon my path.'\"Forget that Jesus said, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\"  (John 14:6, by the way.)  No, no, no.  Many willfully ignore that Jesus said such un-ecumenical things like this.  The hippie-Jesus thinks that there are many paths to God.  The whole \"one source, many wells\" philosophy.  Don't believe me?  Why do you think the folks at the Jesus Seminar blackballed this very verse (John 14:6)?  \"Our great, loving, hippie-Jesus believes that everyone comes to 'god' in his own way!  He would never say that!\"  Blackball.  (That last quotation wasn't an actual quote, by the way.)(2)  And, though the nature of the good and evil chapter is tempered by a sort-of \"love thy neighbor\" philosophy, it still defines \"good\" not as following Judaeo-Christian morals, or even a \"do unto others\" prescription, but \"You are good when you are one with yourself.\"If it feels good to you, do it.  Sure, Gibran later seems to warn against unbridled pleasure-seeking, \"Pleasure is a freedom-song, But it is not freedom.  It is the blossoming of your desires, But it is not their fruit.\"  Later,  however, such hedonism is considered a path (\"a truth\") to God:\"Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are judged and rebuked.  I would not judge or rebuke them.  I would have them seek.\"Thus the paradox of liberalism: the Prophet rebukes you for rebuking those hedons amongst you.  They are only on their path.  \"You are so wrong to tell them that they are wrong!\"  Ah, relativism!  The problem with unchecked hedonism (\"You are good when you are one with yourself,\" if you prefer) is that mankind always finds some inner reasoning to justify their evil actions.  Man always finds a way to make pleasure-at-any-cost, devoid of anything else, his god.I don't want to seem as if I am some stick in the mud, a prude, or an over-moralizing and self-righteous Christian.  Christian I am, and hedon I sometimes am.  I can get wheat from the chaff out of \"The Prophet.\"  There is much here that is good, and some of it is artfully written.  Some of Gibran's thoughts are even profound.  Still, there is much here that is bad, there is still some shuck on the ear, so to speak.  Sometimes you must take the wrong path which leads you to the right path, but there is just one right path, not several.  Gibran never seems to say that, and, since he was a Lebanese Christian, I find that sad.There is much here to lead you astray.I will not hold it against Gibran that \"The Prophet\" has inspired numerous imitations of lesser-poetic talent, sad purveyances of even fewer truths.  Yes, I am speaking of (amongst others) the trite, inane cacophonies of Paulo Coelho.And, for those reviewers and readers who think that \"The Prophet\" is the most poetic, most enlightening, most cosmically spiritual tome of all time: try reading the Psalms in the KJV with an open mind.(Yes.  I invented the word \"hedon.\"  \"Hedonist\" sounds like a philosophical school, as does \"epicurean.\"  The latter, too, is for an aesthete.  Let's say a hedon is a pleasure-seeker without the philosophy.  A hedon is an unsophisticate.

When someone buys a book for me, there is a certain obligation to actually read it, but doing so takes away time from the books I really want to read. There are so many books on my reading list and so little time to read them all that getting an unasked-for book feels like someone actually stealing from me: stealing valuable reading time.In the case of *The Prophet,* however, I did not resent the choice of my benefactor, even though I had not asked for it.First of all, it was a very quick read, consisting of twenty-nine poetic speeches by the fictional \"prophet.\" He delivers them as his last word on various topics, since he is about to head back home after having lived in a foreign city for twelve years, and the people ask him to speak on all the important issues that touch on human life: family, food, work, emotions, economics, social problems, art, morality, spirituality, death, etc.On most of these issues, the prophet takes what might be called an Eastern stance. He stresses the importance of \"letting go\" rather than \"taking charge,\" whether it's in relationship to your children, conflict situations, or the end of your life.I did not find it necessary, however, to fully agree with this Eastern outlook to appreciate the book, both for its poetic beauty and for inspiring thoughts.

It has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American edition alone has sold more than four million copies.  It is considered both by Gibran himself, and by the general public to be his literary masterpiece.  The Story is about a prophet leaving a town, and as he leaves he imparts some of his knowledge to the towns people.  Gibran himself was born in Lebanon in 1883.  He was a poet, artist, and philosopher.  His fame and influence has spread through the world, superceding linguistic and cultural barriers.  His poetry has been translated into more than twenty languages, and his drawings and paintings have been distributed and showcased all around the world.  In the last twenty years of his life he lived in the United States, and began to write in English.  The book The Prophet was written during this time period.  His words and pictures change the way that people look at life, and people find them to be an expression of the deepest impulses of man's heart and mind.  The Prophet is about a man who is leaving a small town called Orphalese where he has made his home for the past twelve years.  He has, for that time period, been waiting for a boat to take him back to the land of his youth.  We are not told where that land is, only that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years.  The entire book occurs on the date of his departure.  As he is about to leave, the townsfolk stop him in the town and request that he tell them about certain things.  He talks to them about life's lessons and imparts his wisdom to them.  He is asked about giving, and he tells the people to give without recognition, because their reward is their own joy.  He also talks about things like marriage, work, friendship and also love.  He speaks about each, and more, describing the way that people should deal with each issue.  This book is an interesting book.  It is ninety-three pages of life's lessons set down in writing.  These are words to live by, and tell others to live by.  This book is certainly a book that everyone should read.  Even if people don't agree with some of the beliefs, they should still read the book, if only to get their mind thinking about life, and it's many quandaries from a different perspective.  This book is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life's lessons to an audience of just about anyone whom he can gather to listen to him.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It's lessons and stories are wise beyond the ages, and still hold up to be as true today as they were when Gibran wrote them in 1923.  The lessons enumerated within this pages are lessons that one would hope were followed by the general population, and I know that if more people read this book, then the world as a whole might become a more easily survivable place.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A masterpiece of life's wisdom", "unixReviewTime": 988934400, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2001"}

This may all sound good, but in practice has little to do with what we observe in the world around us (and is completely unworkable both individually and in society!)The traditional Christian view, boring though it may at first seem, is that there is no perfect holiness within us; rather, we holistic unities of imperfection and rebellion. Granted, we consist of both material and immaterial substance, but the material and immaterial are inseperable except by death. Gibran deals with the rational problems arising from his irreconcilable view of the sprit versus the world by, of course, positing reincarnation upon us.Christian theology deals with all the issues addressed by Gibran, but without making us all out to be God. And without relying on the terrible concept of reincarnation (the only thing I can think of that would be worse than enduring a lifetime of suffering would be to endure an endless procession of lifetimes of suffering).

A local seeress who knows him best asks him to share his wisdom so that it will endure for generations to come.So, he reveals his wisdom on love, birth, marriage, children, pain, talking, pleasure, death any so much more.It is a profound work, and here is his advice on marriage so you may judge for yourself:You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.You shall be together when white wings of death scatter your days.Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.But let there be spaces in your togetherness,And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.Love one another but make not a bond of love:Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.And stand together, yet not too near together:For the pillars of the temple stand apart,And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.Its not a little similar to theTao Te Ching: A New English Version (Perennial Classics)where a border guard recognises Lao Tzu, and asks him to share his wisdom as he goes into exile.

A great friend's father (a high school guidance counselor) gave it to me in an attempt to broaden my philosophical, intellectual and literary horizons.  The book had the desired effect.  I opened it that afternoon and did not put it down until I had read every last page in one sitting.  I was transfixed.  I finished reading it in approximately three hours, front to back.  My philosophy, my world view and my life were all changed forever.Tons of people have reviewed the textual content of the book but it is more than that.  This work is arguably the greatest literary accomplishment of Gibran's lifetime and it isn't just textual.  It is also textural.  The Prophet is poetic and it inspires a sense of inner peace and harmony just by reading the words written on its pages; simple messages which resonated like a cannon in a young mind.  As it turns out they still resonate in exactly the same way now that I am older.  I have read The Prophet a total of 22 times during the course of my life and each time I read it I discover some new facet of my existence that I can apply its wisdom to.Over the years I have shared this amazing book with loved ones, friends, coworkers, even a university professor, who to my great surprise, had never read it.  This is a seminal work and should be required reading for any person who considers himself/herself to be 'educated'.Aside from the passages in the Bible, this is the greatest work of literary art in existence.

I read just one page and Gibran's words were so beautiful, so powerful, so truthful that I had to get a copy of my own.Almustafa, the main character, is a prophet of God; he is Christ, Buddha, Krishna, the Higher Self. He is the familiar soul that walks between heaven and earth in all humans and all creatures.

One by one they ask Almustafa to speak of love, of children, of eating and drinking, crime and punishment, of houses and self-knowledge, among other basic topics of life. His answers come in precisely crafted poetry that is deceptively simple, stunningly beautiful and potent in their spiritual depth. Afmustafa's responses to the people of Orphalese represent the distillation of Gibran's own Self-mastery, his own unified consciousness, and spiritual awakening.This short book should be read slowly and repeatedly until all its hidden truths are unveiled, even if it takes rereading it years after the first time.

Having let things slip a little longer than intended I started reading it again, this time not trying to slam thru pages but rather reading one or two passages over lunch and seeing  the impact on me.  This time things flowed somewhat better for me.  The individual passages are nicely done covering aspects of life relevant to anyone.  While I don't always agree with Mr. Gibran philosophy for a subject, some are particularly moving; for me in particular his passage on Joy and Sorrow was borderline earth shaking with his explanation of the relationship of the two, describing to me why both can be so strong.Rating this one is extremely complex.  Some passages touch you and make you think about your life or what you have; others flow over you, whether discarded for future consumption is to be determined later.  Because I wasn't touched by all, I call this a very strong 4 star book and can easily see why lovers of poetry or philosophy could call this a 5 star book.

Any two sentences in this legacy of living can be made into a thought-altering quote.Gibran uses a prose style throughout. Short lines of words written as freestyle poetry create a rich medium to deliver his words.Each section has something poweful to say, but some of my favorites were those on Work, Giving, Children, Crime and Punishment, Freinds, Time, and of course Love.As oppposed to most books containing the word \"Prophet\" anywhere in the title, Gibran expresses life as something to be enjoyed and soaked in as many ways as possible. The book does not stress the punishment of sins, but to bask in pleasure and not look back. Decadence is not suggested, but the basic purpose of Gibran's legacy is to tell us that life is short and must be lived without regrets.It is a book that includes such beautiful metaphors and velvetty language that you are always sucked into reading \"just one more section.\" What makes the book work is not just the simple genius of the author's statements, but also the beauty of his words, the flow of his language.I hate to be like everyone else (in more instances than just this), but it does change you.

What can you say about a book that you believe to be one-of-a-kind? I have yet to find a book that I can compare it to. I suppose I could at least explain why I find this book to be so unique.First of all this book covers most all of life's complex issues in the simplest fashion, and in that respect it is uncanny in presentation. Secondly and astonishingly the author portrays a story of a prophet speaking to his people, but I cannot be so shallow to think that I am reading a said story... I am not reading the said story--what is actually happening is that I am the listener and Kahlil Gibran is the prophet himself.  I strongly feel that if you the reader do not come away with this feeling yourself, you are probably reading some other book.I think what would do justice in this review is to explain some feelings you may get from a brief reading, in fact with that said, I can state with confidence that many readers will peruse only a few pages at a time because the content is overwhelming in its ability to provoke thought and feeling. You may feel at times that some all important life questions are being answered. You may feel regret  like I did,  I regret not having this book earlier in life to help me. I believe that a great many of you will feel amazed. It is truly amazing how such a short simple book can have such a profound impact on a person searching for answers to life's puzzles.There is a quote from the \"Urantia Book\" that is appropriate in closing this review. The quote helps to sum up one of the unexpected feelings I received from this incredible story, and that quote is.. \"The argumentative defense of any proposition is inversely proportional to the truth contained.\" ...and I give this quote because this book gives you the feeling that you are reading divine truth. I am a firm believer that if Kahlil Gibran is not a modern day prophet, no one is, and you too may come away with this belief because this is a story that really speaks to the heart of humanity.

Within each tiny chapter, profound moments can occur as we are given insight into unfamiliar territory, a place of thought not commonly existing in daily life but familiar to spiritual teachers.Kahlil Gibran magically explores the connection between sorrow and joy and how the deeper the sorrow you experience, the more joy you can contain. Talking becomes thoughts that can no longer \"dwell in the solitude of your heart\" so they \"live in your lips.\"As Almustafa waits for a ship to take him back to the isle of his birth, he climbs a hill outside the city walls and looks out to sea. When his \"ship arrives\" he is suddenly filled with regret, yet knows he must follow his destiny and return home.\"Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret?\"The priests and priestesses ask him to remain in very poetic ways: \"Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in our midst become a memory.\"Almustafa only cries and doesn't seem to speak until a woman named Almitra appears. She is a woman who believed in him and he seems to have great fondness for her. We are not given any insight into their relationship, but his respect for her is unquestioned. She understands he must leave, but asks him to give the city his wisdom. She promises they will pass this wisdom down through the generations.While viewing pictures of Bsharri in Northern Lebanon, the mountains and the mist are almost a unique doorway into Kahlil Gibran's mind. He lived in a lush region where cascading falls, rugged cliffs and cedar trees influenced his art and writing.We can imagine his thoughts of home and this book was actually first imagined when he wrote a short story as a teenager. A Bostonian poet, Josephine Peabody, caught Gibran's attention at an art exhibition and she later referred to him as \"her young prophet.\"  She also wrote poems about Gibran's life and how she imagined his life in Bsharri. His life is woven into his writing in the most beautiful ways. He names his book for a woman he loves and his writing is infused with spiritual teachings and influences from his journey from Lebanon to New York.The story has an unassuming plot, but the lessons are eternal and the ending is surprisingly tender. I was left with a sense of longing that is still drifting along with me like the mists of Bsharri. The Prophet is not just a book to read, it is a spiritual journey to experience. It may take three or more days to complete the reading of this tiny book. I could only read about a third at a time because it is saturated in wisdom and many of the chapters want to be read and read again, until they are absorbed into your soul and written on your heart.\"But if you love and must needs have desires,let these be your desires:To melt and be like a running brook thatsings its melody to the night.\" ~Kahlil Gibran~The Rebecca Review", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Invisible Revealed", "unixReviewTime": 1117411200, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2005"}

Everybody I knew in those days had to be able to discuss it intelligently or risk being thought to have a gap in our characters as people. A folk/ talking blues singer of that era (I forget who) referred to this book in a lyric:\"...a copy of Kahlil Gibran's 'The Prophet' with all the significant passages highlighted--the whole damn BOOK was highlited...\"In truth, the whole phenomenon was symptomatic of the societal immaturity of my generation as young adults. It taught us all sorts of theoretical concepts of human nature that were not necessarily reflective of the real world--consideration, the dignity of each person, peace, love, repudiation of prejudice--all of this in a world that anything but reflected such beliefs in Gibran's day. And except for the hippy-dippy pseudo-enlightenment we tried to cram down the world's throat in our day, our peculiar era was no better. We just used Gibran and other such philosophers to peer-pressure one another into self-defeating meekness. If someone you knew was erudite enough to understand philosophy but didn't have the moxie to stand up to people when he should, Gibran was the ideal way to make him a bona fide doormat and make him think he liked it. I won't even try to speculate how \"relevant\" Gibran is nowadays. From the perspective of a sadder but wiser man--or at least not quite as stupid--I give you this Sting lyric from the song \"Consider Me Gone\" for consideration:\"To search for perfectionIs all very wellBut to wait for HeavenIs to live here in Hell\"", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Deceptively pseudo-scriptural", "unixReviewTime": 1022025600, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2002"}

I myself feel it to be a kind of sentimental popular mixture of Whitman and Zarathustra, but without the great lyric sweeping of the former or the fierce intellectual irony of the latter.I believe the most famous section of the work of twenty- six poetic essays is the one on 'Love\"Here is some of this:\"Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;For love is sufficient unto love.When you love you should not say, \"God is in my heart,\" but rather, I am in the heart of God.\"And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.To know the pain of too much tenderness.To be wounded by your own understanding of love;And to bleed willingly and joyfully.To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;To return home at eventide with gratitude;And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.I am reminded when I read this of Bellow's description of the healer in 'Seize the Day' Dr. Temkin. On the one hand he says and thinks that it is phony  , and on the other he hears certain things and says ' True , True.'.I must admit my reaction remains mixed.

Gibran is justly famous for rich metaphors that brilliantly highlight the pursuit of Truth and Goodness amidst all the darkness and light of human nature.This is a book to read alone or with a partner, to give and receive, to go back to again and again.Note: the excerpts available in Amazon's \"Search This Book\" facility unfortunately do not do \"The Prophet\" justice, since only the book's introduction is included, whereas the wisdom does not begin unfolding until a bit later.  Therefore I've taken the liberty of including here another excerpt which more properly demonstrates the gentle power of Gibran's writing.---And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, \"Speak to us of Children.\"And he said:Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.You may give them your love but not your thoughts.For they have their own thoughts.You may house their bodies but not their souls,For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "lyrically evokes your finest self", "unixReviewTime": 1100995200, "reviewTime": "11 21, 2004"}

To be honest I have no idea why I downloaded this. I have a vague memory of listening to a radio programme on the author some time ago, which I found interesting, so it must have been that!  Gibran is described in Wikipedia as, 'the third best selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Laozi.'The book is written in bible-esque so if you are not a fan of that or indeed of religion it may not be a book for you.  On the other hand and bearing in mind this was published in 1926 almost every passage can be related to every single one of us and our lives today.There are no chapter numbers in this short volume but they are defined by the questions asked of 'The Prophet' by the assembled town folk as he prepares to leave them, returning to his 'home'.MarriageChildrenGivingEating and DrinkingWorkJoy and SorrowCrime and PunishmentFreedomReason and PassionPainTeachingFriendshipGood and EvilPrayerPleasureReligionDeathSo many of the words written by Gibran over 80 years ago, must surely, if you are tempted to purchase this book, resonate with something in your life today and his simple but reasoning outlook will remind you to step back and reflect on how you look at life and maybe think that there is something that you can do to change, for the better, on how you interact with others and with yourself!I'm not saying that I have had a religious or moral epiphany while reading this book, I personally still have no idea whether I am an atheist, agnostic or just a plane old fence sitter waiting for something different or better to come along, if that is indeed possible.  I did write somewhere in regard to the Bible, and I suppose in the same tone the Koran would be included, that I look upon the former as a good novel and if only more people would read it (them) without the religious zealotry and bigotry surrounding it (them), the world would probably be a far better place for all humankind, but that aint gonna happen.  But that should not take away from the fact that there are important life lessons in these works that are as relevant today as they were when they were written, as Mr Gibran's words, I believe, fall firmly within that description.Enjoy.....Editing for Kindle: 4 out 5Reading Enjoyment: 5 out of 5Plot:Overall Rating: 5 out of 5Chapters:Page length: 133", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Words of Wisdom for Everyone", "unixReviewTime": 1395792000, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2014"}

I loved this book when I read it and I wrote one of my (still) best poems while I was in the state of mind this book put me in. (I'm positive it was just after I turned 16 because I have memories connected to reading it in my room with an open window and hearing a Friday night football game in the distance from the high school...and not wanting to go to another football game because I had to free my friend from the outside port-a-potty after my other friend thought she was being funny and held the door closed when the other girl was going to come out....and naturally my claustrophobic friend started screaming and freaking out. She did the same thing I would do.Anyone of any age can enjoy this book,I just wish I had a copy around so I could refresh my memory and do a more detailed review.

I always read books I really like more than one time.This book and The Little Prince by Saint Exupery;Siddhartha,Demian and Steppenwolf (all by Herman Hesse) are books I read at the same time period and that I also don't have anymore,either because I gave my copy to someone;or,had bought another copy for myself and also gave that copy away, or,they just went the way of all things,as things go...in time (and my 16th birthday was quite awhile ago...sigh.... 16 has also \"gone the way of all things\"....but not completely!)Anyone who likes The Prophet (or any of the other titles I mentioned) can consider themselves lucky if they have a friend who has read,or who has one of these books on their bookshelves;or who has a friend that would also appreciate this type of literature.

For twelve years he has loved, cried, laughed, taught, dreamt, and lived with strangers.  He is joyous when he sees the sails on the horizon.  &quot;Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and aloneness without regret?&quot;What can a poor man leave for those he has learned to love?  Almustafa walks through the city, across the sands, toward the shore; as he does, he pauses to answer the questions of the heart.  &quot;Nor is it a thought I leave behind me, but a heart made sweet with hunger and thirst.&quot;His words will pass from generation to generation in Orphalese.  The metaphor is reality, for the wisdom of his celebration of life is as powerful today as it was when it was published in 1923.Some of my favorite passages are:Of Joy and Sorrow -- &quot;The deeper the sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.  Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?&quot;Of Giving -- &quot;You give but little when you give of your possessions.  It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.&quot;Of Reason and Passion -- &quot;Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul.&quot;Of Time -- &quot;You would make a stream upon whose bank you would sit and watch its flowing.  Yet, the timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness.  And knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream.&quot;Each phrase carries you from one thought to another.

Walker \"Home School Book Review\"", "helpful": [11, 40], "reviewText": "\"The Prophet\" is Almustafa, called \"the chosen and the beloved,\" who has lived twelve years in the foreign city of Orphalese, and is now waiting for the ship that is to come and take him back to the isle of his birth.  Just as the ship appears, all the men and women of the community, including the elders of the city and the priests and priestesses, come to say farewell.  They ask him to stay, but he refuses.  Then the local seeress named Almitra addresses him as \"Prophet of God\" and asks him to speak to them of love and then marriage.  After this, others ask him to speak of various subjects, some lofty such as children, giving, and joy and sorrow, and others more mundane, such as eating and drinking, work, houses, and buying and selling.  There are in fact a total of 26 short chapters in which \"the Prophet\" holds forth before he takes his leave.  Kahlil Gibran was born Gubran Khalil Gibran to a Maronite Catholic family in the historic town of Bsharri in modern-day Lebanon, then part of the Ottoman Empire. His mother Kamila was the daughter of a priest.  When his father was imprisoned for embezzlement, Kamila decided to follow her brother to the United States, settling in the South End of Boston, MA, then the second largest Lebanese-American community in the United States. Due to a mistake at school, he was registered as Kahlil.As a young man Gibran studied art and began a literary career.  His first book for the Alfred A. Knopf publishing company, was The Madman in 1918, a slim volume of aphorisms and parables written in a Biblical-like cadence somewhere between poetry and prose.  The Prophet is said to be an early example of \"inspirational fiction\" consisting of a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose.  The book became especially popular during the 1960s with the American counterculture and New Age movements.  Much of Gibran's writings seems based on Christianity, but his mysticism reveals a convergence of several other influences as well, including Islam, Sufism, Hinduism, and theosophy.  To illustrate the relativistic nature of Gibran's theology, \"the Prophet\" says, \"Say not, `I have found the truth,' but rather, `I have found a truth.'\"  Jesus said, \"You shall know THE truth\" (John 8:32), and, \"I am the way, THE truth, and the life\" (John 14:6).  Gibran followed The Prophet with The Garden of The Prophet, which narrates Almustafa's discussions with nine disciples following his return after an intervening absence and was published posthumously in 1933.  Gibran had died in New York City, NY, on April 10, 1931; the cause was determined to be cirrhosis of the liver and tuberculosis.I would never have gone out and purchased this book myself.  However, I have heard of it all my life.  It is supposed to be a classic and a \"spiritual masterpiece,\" so when I found it in my father's library after his death, I decided to keep it and read it.  My reaction is, \"Ugh.\"  As far as I am concerned, it is mostly pantheistic nonsense.  Someone might say, \"It's all Greek to me,\" but since I took two years of Greek in college, if it were \"all Greek\" I might be able to make some sense of it.  I'll just say it's all gobblety-gook to me.  The Chicago Post said that The Prophet \"brings to one's ears the majestic rhythm of Ecclesiastes.\"  Ecclesiastes I can understand; The Prophet I do not!  This doesn't mean that there's nothing good in it.  The ravings of a lunatic sometimes contain a kernel of truth.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  However, there is nothing of value that might be gained from The Prophet which can't be learned a whole lot better by simply reading the Bible.  Besides, ten of the twelve full-page drawings by the author are rather immodest and consist solely of nude figures.  Of course, this is not surprising when you read what \"the Prophet\" says about clothes.  \"Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.  And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.  Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment.\"  Oh, by the way, even as simply \"poetry\" it just doesn't do anything for me.  It is not a book that I would recommend to anyone under any circumstances.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "it doesn't make good nonsense", "unixReviewTime": 1325116800, "reviewTime": "12 29, 2011"}

Despite being a native-born Arabic speaker, Gibran wrote The Prophet in English, ensuring that his powerful words lost nothing in translation.The work's 28 short chapters recount the words of a prophet as he leaves his home to depart on a new journey.  The words that flow from the prophet's mouth and onto the pages are philosophical and spiritual treatises on all aspects of life.  Chapters discuss the range of human experiences and include discussions such as \"On Friendship\", \"On Pain\" and \"On Death.\"  What unites the 28 chapters is Gibran's thought provoking and probing literary style as Gibran's prophet invokes his listeners to live life to the fullest.  The book is not overtly religious but every word and sentence is filled with a spiritual clarity.The book is eminently quotable with every chapter providing a nugget of truth worthy of repeating.  Amazingly, Gibran packs his masterpiece into less than 100 pages, making it a very quick and easy read.  Readers will find themselves returning to The Prophet again and again to recapture the beauty of Gibran's words.The Prophet, which Gibran himself recognized as his greatest masterpiece, is a timeless literary classic.

Both these stories have a very Tolkienish way about them, it is an interesting exercise to compare and contrast the characters as they are introduced. It is a pity that Garner's books, faring less well than 'The Hobbit', dropped off the literary radar in the 1980's, but with the benefit of Potter power they are now back in style with new artwork on the cover.Garner's special art is to take a basic swords-and-sorcery story and elevate it into a poetry-and-powers myth with gritty heroes and terrifying villains who hard to defeat and not always easy to spot. This story of Colin and Susan's second adventure is aimed at a slightly older audience than the Weirdstone, has Susan in the lead role, and has more depth and menace along with some sly humour. The Morrigan is back, not yet at the height of her powers, but ready for revenge. The elves are suffering and dying from the pollution caused by Man: they must retreat to cleaner, remoter places. The battles in magic and swordplay are more deadly and more personal and more realistic. The havoc and hard pace of war are felt in the prose, which is breathless and a little wild itself. The wizard Cadellin takes more of a back seat in this adventure but he does explain (in chapter four) why the coming of the 'Age of Reason' and industrialism was more of a coming of the age of Materialism and a retreat from Reason. Hence the great rift between our Man's world of material values, and the worlds of magic and the life of the spiritual values.Now as every parent knows, children's books have the power of forming the child's mind. (True even in the age of film and video, as books are both more personal and make mind-expanding demands on the imagination. Films just fill up whatever space is in your head, they do not create it. Books are not just good for you, they are more fun.) So with magical adventures being very much back in style now is a good time to get the various authors into some sort of order. So, without going back to the ancient Greeks, where does Alan Garner fit in? We can easily go back a century or so: F. Anstey (Vice Versa), George MacDonald (Princess and Curdie stories), and E. Nesbit (House of Arden, etc), Tolkien (Hobbit, Farmer Giles of Ham), C.S. Lewis (Narnia, the land of youth), Ursula K. LeGuin (Earthsea), and Alan Garner. And, as Rowling's ghost Peeves puts it, 'Wee Potty Potter', brings us up to date.So there are two main routes to magic. Anstey, MacDonald, Nesbit, Garner, and Rowling write a story that exercises magic in this world, and the two things collide with exciting degrees of chaos and depth. The results are serious or hilarious, or both. Garner manages to interface the two worlds with superior art. But a higher priced ticket will take you to a whole new world. Tolkien, Lewis, and LeGuin create whole worlds of their own and people it with new peoples - a fully magical world. The magic is integrated, truly part of the fabric of that world, not just added to make it fizz. One you are in, you belong there for a while. You return and your own world is now a little more magical. The whole range of literary forms is now possible, even super-possible as we no longer rely on supposed 'realism' to make the effects. They go beyond just making a magical talisman or two (some brilliantly done, others less so), and seeing 'what happens'. They make new countries and skies, new kingdoms and peoples, new languages and rules. Ultimately they are the suns and the others are the moons.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Suns and Moons of Gomrath", "unixReviewTime": 1054252800, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2003"}

Richard Burton is the First Voice, which connects all the characters, played by twenty-eight men, women, and children. With perfect diction and the sense of character which only a great actor can convey, Burton rolls his R's, modulates his voice in pitch and intensity, and makes Thomas's poetry come fully alive--full of alliteration and various kinds of rhyme, with nouns and adjectives used as verbs to convey action and sense impressions simultaneously, and always a wry humor and honesty of feeling.Depicting one full day in the life of a small town in Wales, Thomas shows its motley residents as they awaken, perform their daily tasks, socialize, gossip, and daydream about the past that might have been and the future that may yet hold hope. When night falls and the residents retire, their losses and disappointments, along with their escapes into dreams, are given voice and poignancy. Polly Garter, with her numerous children by numerous fathers, dreams of Willie, a very small man who was the love of her life. Captain Cat, the blind bell-ringer, thinks of all the sailors he knew who died at sea. Mr. Pugh dreams of poisoning his wife, and young Gwenny, who has extorted pennies from the little boys who do NOT want to kiss her, plans for the next day and more pennies.The sound effects provide context for the drama without overpowering the narrative--a cock's crow, the clip-clop of horses, the bark of dogs, footsteps, the sea, bell buoys--and simple songs add to the realism and the sense of character and place.

This catastrophe fails at both. I have read many many entries in this genre from the extraordinary to the putrid.  Lady of Hay falls somewhere below this last category.  As other readers have commented, this book is about 200 pages too long. The author has managed to confuse tedium with suspense by dragging out the conclusion long past the point of reader exhaustion.  Ms. Erskine's attempts to interweave the present day \"plot\" with historical narrative is a complete failure, as she only manages to disrupt both story lines resulting in a herky-jerky narrative flow that became quite annoying.  Compounding the problem, not a single character is the slightest bit sympathetic, and although I began the read with curiosity and interest, I ended feeling frustrated and cheated.  There are many red herrings dropped along the way that kept me reading, but I got no satisfaction at the end.  Why do we meet everyone's mother?  How many literary agents, photographers and editors need to be introduced by their names, only to drop from sight 20 pages later?  What about nurse Jeanne's foreshadowing of Matilda's illegitimate daughter ultimately giving her secret away resulting in calamity?  Did I miss that scene as I waded through episode after repetitive episode of modern Jo swooning in the rain as she \"channels\" Lady Matilda?  There are too many superfluous characters, seemingly all of whom are interested in and experienced with past life regression, who I kept expecting would have some role in the overall \"meaning\" of this morass, but they never did.  Not to mention, most of the players seem good candidates for Alcoholics Anonymous.  I cannot recall another novel which features wine, ale, scotch, Pimms and their ilk as the central focus in seemingly every scene.  The insane behavior of all principals appeared to be nothing more than the result of years of alcohol poisoning - a Medieval Lost Weekend.  I became so exasperated with their antics and cruel misdeeds that I actually found myself rooting for them all to be sent to the pokey or a rehab facility.This book was a major disappointment in every way.

Bakura and Biotechnology used by the Ssi Ruuk is revisited in the ill intentioned NJO series.  Though it didn't seem to fit when I first read the book, the story here does fit nicely with the entire Expanded Universe.On the timeline I have this one at year 4.5 ANH.  The story takes place right after the battle at Endor in ROTJ.  Ben appears and tells Luke to go to Bakura.  Luke, at age 20 is in command and can only assemble a small force after the devastation of the battle they have just fought.  Naturally the Falcon, Han, Leia and Chewy are available to assist.The point of the plot is for the Rebels to help the Imperial garrison on Bakura defend against an invasion that is coming from the unknown regions.  The invaders are Large Reptilian creatures that, when they speak sound like flutes playing.  They use entechment to take the essence of sentient beings and place that essence inside their machines to run those machines.This is a book I recommend reading if you are now deciding to read the stories written for the classic era which starts with the Han Solo trilogy and ends with the Zahn Duology and the Dark Horse comic Union.

Produced in Britain, and read by two British actors, Paul McGann and Regine Candler, it concentrates on English poets, with short forays into works by American authors.Warhorse selections - &quot;Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot; - are mixed with less well-known poems like &quot;The Dead Statesman&quot;, a surprising (at least to me) burst of post-WWI bitterness from Kipling. Glory and horror intertwine from the earliest works to the most recent, but horror dominates as the present approaches. Changes in attitudes about war and patriotism come to vivid life. The effect of hearing these works read aloud is almost one of traveling in time. Paul McGann reads the lion's share - not surprising with so masculine a subject matter-and is IMO much the better reader, tho Ms. Candler is strikingly effective in places.  The majority of works are from WWI - the period that produced so many gifted poets - and in them one hears older, strongly-held beliefs about Duty and Country clashing with the despairing fury engendered by the incomprehensible waste of trench warfare. McGann is able to bring understanding and force to everything from innocent jingoism to pity, from rage to transcendance, without forcing the material. His readings of WWII and Cold War pieces (Reed's &quot;Lessons of the War&quot;, Lowell's &quot;For the Union Dead&quot;, and McGough's &quot;Icarus Allsorts&quot; are remarkable) bring home the fear and ambivalence felt by a humanity realizing its power to destroy itself and the earth that supports it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Evocations of War", "unixReviewTime": 970272000, "reviewTime": "09 30, 2000"}

His books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. However, there is much more to Tolkien than many people realize. His translations and teaching positions are not always mentioned, yet they are credentials that make his other works even more astounding!  The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone.  Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style.  I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created.  I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before.  I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer.  Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears.  I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more....  Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him.  Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot;  Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien)  Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar.  I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature.  I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute.  Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R.

B Collins Jr.", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Historic fiction requires exceptional skills to capture character as well as time and place. Beryl Bainbridge's Master Georgie certainly excels in this regard, reminding me of the skills of Hilary Mantel. The plight of a Crimean War surgeon comes alive in all its gore and misery and insanity. The tale is told through the eyes of the surgeon's brother-in-law, his off and on boyfriend and photographic assistant, and Myrtle, an orphan informally adopted by the family and mother of his children. The Crimean War offers a backdrop of incompetent diplomatic and military leadership dissolving into a nightmare of gore, horror, disease, dysentery, crime, and cruelty. Bainbridge captures the disorganized international disaster with many horrible bloody details, having her characters do the best they can to survive the catastrophe. Yet, Bainbridge captures more than just history, time, place, and character for her writing is poetic and her attention to detail is superb. Early in the novel, Myrtle cleans the dog hair off of a tiger skin rug and as she pulls the white dog hairs from the brush, they float like dandelion seed up the wind-draft of the staircase and nestle on the chandelier. It is such details that make the book beautiful and horrible at the same time. The pace of the book is excellent and she moves the reader from critical chapter to chapter in the lives of the main characters. I almost think she wrote too little in this book. I would have loved to have the book twice as long. The character of Pompey Jones, the bisexual street urchin, is fascinating and I wish Bainbridge had written a novel just for this self-aware, self-assured, character to follow Master Georgie. Bainbridge actually focuses much of the novel on the character of Myrtle, and we learn as much about her amazing strength of character as we do about that of her sometime lover George Hardy. Myrtle and Pompey are both orphans, street wise, highly intelligent, and are recognized for their strengths by the Hardy family.George Hardy is never fully explained and made visible to the viewer for his motives are somewhat hidden. As a homosexual or bisexual physician from an upper class home, it appears that his service in the Crimean is somewhat of a penance, a sacrifice, for his sexuality. He strives to be the perfect son to his father, mother, and siblings, yet the secret of his sexuality means that a critical part of him must be hidden from his family. George Hardy appears to sacrifice himself during the Crimean War due to his sexual orientation over which he has no control. In some ways this is also a study of gay guilt in the Victorian period and the mechanisms and strategies undertaken to atone for an unacceptable sexual orientation. George is contrasted with Pompey who seems much more at home with his bisexuality, recognizing it as more a part of himself and as an asset by which he can manipulate both men and women. The narrative of war is haunting, reminding me of the outstanding novels of Pat Barker about World War I. We read of handsome shirtless soldiers dying from eating unwashed cherries or horses bleeding to death while standing with bullet holes through their body. It is the third narrator, Dr. Potter, George's brother-in-law that offers unique looks at all the other characters. Potter is intellectual and foolish at the same time. He lacks practicality but his power of observation is evident.

The 1840s in England do not come  alive quite as well for Ms. Bainbridge as the early 1900s of her The  Birthday Boys and Every Man for Himself.  This may be a result of the  narrative coming from different observers of the events, which perforce  must take the time to limn each separate narrator as he or she appears.  While this method succeeds quite powerfully in The Birthday Boys, with the  various members of the Scott expedition continuing the story from their  differing points of view, it does not work as well here.  Master Georgie  lacks the successive stream of events, as exists in The Birthday Boys,  which could hold together the differing shifts of narrative.However, the  story takes on an absorbing sense of urgency as the 1850s arrive and the  characters shift to the Crimea.  These later episodes certainly contain the  strongest writing in this work.  Ms. Bainbridge's descriptions of war are  chillingly gruesome, even though the focus is usually only upon the fringe  of battle itself, but seem at times to be lazily gloomy.  Certainly the  atrocities of the Crimean or any war merit the most horrid descriptions,  but aside from some poignant scenes, much of the horror is conveyed through  somewhat stock descriptions of the filth, disease, deprivations and  insanity that accompany every war.  Furthermore, neither the action nor the  characters, especially the title character who throughout remains shadowy  and elusive, seem to progress substantially during these latter stages of  the novel.All in all, this is still a very fine book, that perhaps  suffers only in comparison to the author's greater works.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A step below the author's best, but still exceptional.", "unixReviewTime": 903657600, "reviewTime": "08 21, 1998"}

I thought it nonsense that an illiterate girl in nineteenth century Liverpool could never write such exquisite prose as evidenced in  this novel, and that this was a case of the authorial voice being too  strong.  As it happened, I couldn't have been more wrong.  This novel is  narrated by the close acquaintances of 'Master Georgie' (although some are  closer than others), starting with the illiterate Myrtle.  Immediately we  are drawn into the action, as this sequence of a photograph being taken  will resound throughout the novel.  'Master Georgie' is incredibly subtle,  and it is only by looking back over it that you begin to appreciate that  this is the most suitable of beginnings.  Here is where Myrtle begins on  her road to becoming a lady.  And what an unsavory road it is, as Myrtle's  help is initially required to cover up the manner in which George Hardy's  father has died, and leads to the bloody battlefields of the Crimea.  Also  assisting with the cover-up is the duck-boy and street urchin, Pompey Jones  and the pompous Dr. Potter, whose narrations are by far the best.  George  Hardy himself is an ambiguous figure, seen only through the eyes of others.  It may be a fault that we never really get to know him.  This is a novel  of cameras, carnality, and carnage.  The dreadful shadow of history is cast  upon it, with the famous charge of the Light Brigade lightly alluded to.  One almost expects to run into a lady with a lamp at every corner, but  fortunately, Bainbridge avoids this excess.  She takes events frozen in  time, such as the front cover's photograph, and brings them into life and  death, and maybe even beyond.  The camera never lies... Or does it?  Bainbridge fervently burrows into the psyche of characters, enabling them  to bring about apparitions vivid enough to be captured by film.  In my  mind's eye, I see Bainbridge pouring over ancient photographs from the  Crimea, trying to put names to faces and to see if she could walk around in  their bloody shoes.  She succeeds.  If I'd have been on 1998's Booker  panel, I know I would have placed Bainbridge before McEwan.

This would be wrong. Master Georgie is no safe tale of country house manners, of marriages imagined by confined, embroidering young women. Beryl Bainbridge's Master Georgie is anything but a tale of such saccharine gentility.Master Georgie is a surgeon and photographer, and the book is cast in six plates - photographic plates, not chapters. Death figures throughout. From start to finish morbidity crashes into the lives of the book's characters. We begin with Mr Moody, dead in a brothel bed, his host of minutes before in shock. Later we move to the Crimean War, where the carnage is graphic, extensive and apparently random. And even then individuals find their own personal ways of adding insult and injury to the suffering.The book uses multiple points of view. We see things Master Georgie's way. Myrtle, an orphan he takes in, adds her perspective. The fussy geologist, Dr Potter, imprints his own version of reality. And still there are less than explained undercurrents, undeclared motives which affect them all. Thus, overall, Master Georgie is a complex and ambitious novel. Though it is set in a major war, the backdrop is never allowed to dominate. The characters experience the consequences of conflict and register their reactions, but we are never led by the nose trough the history or the geography of the setting.But we also never really get to know these people. Myrtle, perhaps, has the strongest presence. She has a slightly jaundiced, certainly pragmatic approach to life. But even she finds the privations of wartime tough. Why the characters of Master Georgie are all so keen to offer themselves as support for the war effort is an aspect of the book that never fully revealed itself. And ultimately this was my criticism of Beryl Bainbridge's book. While the overall experience was both rewarding and not a little shocking, I found there was insufficient delineation between the characters and their differing motives. The beauty of the prose, however, more than made up for any shortcoming.

It's ironic how attibutes like these can possibly be descriptions of a good writer. It is these very faults that bring about the ruin of MASTER GEORGIE.The novel spans the years 1846-1854. Master Georgie, or George Hardy,  is the young son of a rich Liverpool merchant. He is a shadow figure in the sense that he never takes over the narration of the story. That is left up to three other characters. One of these is Myrtle, an orphan who was taken in by the Hardys as a child and is deeply in love with George. She follows him in his restless wanderings of Liverpool. One night, in a sordid episode they find George's father dead in the bed of a prostitute. Along with another character who does narration, Pompey Jones (a street hustler), they are able to cover up the scandal that would have hurt and tarnished his family. The three characters are bonded by this secret for the rest of their lives, and as the novel progresses this deepens into love, both sexual and spiritually. It becomes a love triangle which causes a lot of pain and little satisfaction. The last voice that enters into the picture is  the eccentric Dr. Potter who has a hankering for George's sister. Nobody likes the guy because instead of confronting life, he dwells instead in books, mainly the classical writers of Rome and Greece. When you start a conversation with him, he begins quoting from an author instead of communicating sense to you. Towards the latter part of the book, all the characters become involved in the Crimean War. Or actually George becomes involved in the war and wherever he is it sucks the others with him. Just like all wars, this one changes the future of not just the combatants but also of the bystanders.The parts of the book set in Liverpool are quite good and interesting. They seem to be written with more passion and personal knowledge than the war scenes. The books problem lies in the deadpan writing. It's like watching the stand up comedy of Steven Wright, where a monotone voice is supposed to make you laugh by its very absence of emotion. It's the same thing here. We are supposed to feel horror and love through understatement when neither of these emotions are capable of understatement. The closer I got to the end, the more bored I got. I skipped over some pages to get to the end. I didn't care about the character's fates.

Her stories rarely have definitive separations between what actually happened, and what might have happened to the characters she creates. The Crimean War is the setting this time, and while historically noteworthy is not as familiar as some of her other subjects, like The Titanic, or the doomed Scott Expedition to the South Pole. What is consistent is her ability to jump about through time periods without ever losing credibility. Each of her books reads as if a unique pen is behind each one. The hand of course is the same, however the moods created are remarkably singular.The character that is the book's title is a complex human study, or if you prefer, a very intricate person but occupied with a mind and personality as muddled, as it is diverse. A grotesque death scene is the entrance for one of the narrator's of the book, an individual that would have lived as a street urchin but for chance, and an ambiguous bit of goodwill. A second street personality with many more wiles and flexible conduct also becomes a member of Master Georgie's entourage. This second narrator has a unique view of events, as he is close when Master Georgie requires, for the latter's sexuality is repressed at best. These are just two people who eventually head to the middle of The Crimean War, and the question that keeps shadowing the reader is why?Escape from the latter half of 19th century London is an easy answer for George, but what of the others? Taking a trip toward an impending war as George's groupies is one matter, staying in the midst of a war is much more puzzling. This is one of the most difficult of Ms. Bainbridge's books that I have read. Previous works have often served as a metaphor for the time they occupy, or the closing act in a World that is about to undergo great disruptive change. This work is not as apparently decisive.One characteristic is consistent, and that is her master's grasp of language. A lapful of cherries that serve as a metaphor will haunt a reader for some time. Her images of the dead and dying are less grotesquely graphic than most writers portray, but are far more disturbing than other wartime battles. This may not be the best of her work if it is the first of hers you experience, however if you can successfully decipher this one, that are several others that are much more comfortable to read.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very Dark Historical Fiction", "unixReviewTime": 996019200, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2001"}

The most important parts are here, though, and if you're a fan of audio books and tapes, which a lot of people like to listen to while they're commuting or travelling in their cars, this one is fine if you don't mind the fact that it's not the entire book. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that it is an abridged version.I had a few other comments about the story. I don't read much fiction these days, sticking mostly to history and nonfiction, but I made an exception for this novel since I am a student and teacher of a couple of Japanese martial arts, and I'd absorbed some small knowledge about things like geishas during my studies. And I'd heard about how good the novel was.I wasn't disappointed. I found Golden's book about a geisha during the 1930s, when the geisha tradition and culture was already dying, to be an accurate, detailed, and well written story about the life of what could have been a typical geisha. For me it's reminiscent of Yasunari Kawabata's famous novel, Snow Country, a bittersweet story about a love affair between a wealthy Tokyo playboy and a provincial geisha in a remote mountain town. Kawabata won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1968. The bittersweet quality derives from the fact that the geisha knows that although by most standards she is still young, she is past her prime and is one of the last of a dying breed.Like Kawabata's novel, Golden's novel sensitively and realistically portrays the world of the geisha during a time when it was already waning. Golden shows that, contrary to western stereotypes of geishas as ordinary prostitutes, they were highly cultured and educated, trained in music, poetry and the arts, and more than able to hold their own and intelligently converse on many subjects with their often wealthy and powerful clients.I understand this is Golden's first book. It's a fine debut by a new author and I hope it won't be his last. It will be interesting to see what he does next after such a spectacular debut.By the way, an interesting little side note here. I've studied a little Japanese, and Japanese is replete with epithets, slang, and various and sundry derogatory words relating to people's mental, moral, and physical shortcomings. One funny aspect of this is how reptiles and especially turtles come in for a lot of abuse. Calling someone a turtle, for example, means you're saying they're slow or unintelligent. And if you call someone a \"deb game,\" it translates literally as \"a turtle with buckteeth.\" But the actual meaning is a \"peeping tom.\"", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good audio version", "unixReviewTime": 1137888000, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2006"}
